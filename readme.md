# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio

## I will be using GitHub at the moment to showcase the coding that I am learning. As of mid July, 2020 I am looking at what my Final project will be for CS50x. In the meantime I am looking towards Django as an option to put together a basic resume/blog website for myself while I continue to build my portfolio.
