# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio

## I will be using GitHub at the moment to showcase the coding that I am learning and using as I create my first portfolio website. As of now I have created a website called reesonstudio.com, it was my first basic website created with WordPress. I plan on remaking that website in an updated manner to showcase my coding projects, as well as a spot for a blog about my other interests.
