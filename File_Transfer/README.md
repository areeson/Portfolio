File_Transfer is one of my early projects that I am working on after finishing CS50x. My goal here is to automate and simplify the process I go through once I plug the sd card from my camera into my computer. I go through a process of downloading the images to a specific folder each time, based off of time date. This would allow the pictures to be organized based off of the pictures info. Eventually I would like this code to also open up Lightroom and start the upload process into that application as soon as it's done downloading and organizing the files from my sd.
